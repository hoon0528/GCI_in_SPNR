Graph Neural Networks for Connectivity Inference in Spatially Patterned Neural Responses
-----------

PyTorch Code for [Graph Neural Networks for Connectivity Inference in Spatially Patterned Neural Responses](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Rccr2wYTEdw)

For baselines, we used tensortools and seqNMF python libraries from [TCA](https://github.com/neurostatslab/tensortools) and [seqNMF](https://github.com/ContextLab/seqnmf) which are cited in our paper.
